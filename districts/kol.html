       <P>
        For the best of Kollam sightseeing , this is a very recent construction, the Jatayu Nature Park is a rock-themed park. The adventure park has 6D theatre an audio-visual digital room, cable car and much more. This is built to promote mythology and adventure tourism. This giant bird statue located on a hill top is certainly unique and something that shouldn’t be missed.

            This lake is the most visited lake and backwater in the state. Lush green waterways lined with palm and coconut trees, there’s no better place to start exploring Kollam that is considered to be one of the best Kollam tourist places. Ashtamudi means ‘Eight Coned’ in Malayalam. A houseboat trip to this lake is among the most popular things to do in Kollam.

                Palaruvi translates to “milky streams”. This is a stunning waterfall located on the Kollam-Shencottah Road, which falls from 300 feet. An ideal time to visit this place is from June to January. Even if you visit this place on a low-season, it is a beautiful picnic spot. The 32nd highest waterfall in India, it is also known to have Ayurvedic properties.
